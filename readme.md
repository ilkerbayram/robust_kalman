This repository contains code that implements the robust Kalman filter proposed in "**Robust Gaussian Filter with Outlier Detection**" by Wang et al., IEEE SPL, 2018, for a special simple case.

The filter is implemented as a class in `robust_gaussian.py`.
The notebook `demo_robust_gaussian.ipynb` demonstrates the use of the class on a simple problem.
